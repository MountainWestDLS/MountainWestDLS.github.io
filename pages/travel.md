## Travel
<p></p>
Getting to Boulder from the Denver International Airport is easy! Downtown Boulder is located 45 minutes by car from the airport, or 1 hour by public bus. We recommend taking the public bus, which is a nice coach bus and costs only $9.00. Taxi fares to Boulder will likely be $60+ with shared ride services averaging between $40 - 80. 
<p></p>
When exiting the airport, follow signs for “Public Transit” or “RTD Station.” You’ll go down escalators or take an elevator to the station. Bus tickets can be purchased at machines on this level, through the RTD phone app, or with cash on the bus (no change provided). The bus leaves from gate 8.
<p></p>
You can view <a href="http://www3.rtd-denver.com/schedules/getSchedule.action?runboardId=2514&routeId=AB&routeType=9&&direction=W-Bound&serviceType=3#day">the bus schedule from the airport online </a>. Select “westbound” as your direction of travel and “Sunday/Holiday” if you are arriving the day before the conference starts. Please note that the last bus leaves the airport at 11:20 PM on the weekend. 
<p></p>
The bus station is located 0.9 miles from the conference venue.
