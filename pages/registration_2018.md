### Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) Tour
The MWDLS is offering an optional complimentary tour of the Laboratory for Atmosphere and Space Physics (LASP) on CU Boulder’s East Campus. Visiting LASP is similar to touring an aerospace museum. Hanging from the ceiling of the lobby is a 26-foot Aerobee 150 sounding rocket along with many other interesting spacecraft and historical objects. Visitors will view models of different spacecraft and satellites, a class-10,000 clean room, a machine shop for building instruments, and the Mission Operations Center from which satellites are operated.

To register for the tour, please do so by selecting the appropriate option as you register for the main symposium via the registration link above.

**The tour is limited to 40 guests. Identification is required for the tour – please bring a photo ID.** If you are not a U.S. citizen and would like to attend the tour, please bring your passport or green card to the tour check-in per requirements of the government lab. If you do not have identification, contact the MWDLS Steering committee at mountainwestdls AT gmail DOT com and we will do our best to make alternative arrangements. Conference participants that elect to join the tour agree to organize their own transportation to LASP and CU Boulder East Campus (1234 Innovation Drive, Boulder CO 80303). The MWDLS Steering Committee will organize groups to walk (30mins), bus (RTD Stampede route), or bike (bike share Bcycle program). Tour participants may also organize group ride shares. If you require alternative transportation accommodations, please contact the MWDLS steering and we will do our best to make accommodations.
