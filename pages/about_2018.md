**The Mountain West Data Librarian Symposium will be hosted by the University of Colorado Boulder and will take place on August 13-14, 2018 in Boulder, Colorado. The Mountain West Data Librarian Symposium is intended to provide librarians located in the Mountain West region who work with research data management issues the chance to network and gain valuable training. However, it is open to all who wish to attend, including future data librarians and data librarians located outside the Mountain West region. Registration will be capped at 60 attendees.**

**The meeting is modeled after the successful Midwest Data Librarian Symposium, now in its fourth year. The program will consist of workshops, unconference sessions, and networking opportunities. Topics covered may include teaching research data management, data sharing and re-use, data curation and preservation, and data literacy.**
